    <h2>Implications of Poor Time Management</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Let’s also consider the consequences of poor time management:</p>

    <ol>
        <li class="li">Poor workflow</li>
        <p>The inability to plan ahead and stick to goals means poor efficiency. For example, if there are several important tasks to complete, an effective plan would be to complete related tasks together or sequentially. However, if you don’t plan ahead, you could end up having to jump back and forth, or backtrack, in doing your work. That translates to reduced efficiency and lower productivity.</p>

        <br>

        <li class="li">Wasted time</li>
        <p>Poor time management results in wasted time. For example, by talking to friends on social media while doing an assignment, you are distracting yourself and wasting time.</p>

        <br>

        <li class="li">Loss of control</li>
        <p>By not knowing what the next task is, you suffer from loss of control of your life. That can contribute to higher stress levels and anxiety.</p>

        <br>

        <li class="li">Poor quality of work</li>
        <p>Poor time management typically makes the quality of your work suffer. For example, having to rush to complete tasks at the last minute usually compromises quality.</p>
